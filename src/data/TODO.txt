1. in accessGraph I should merge 
		Map<Integer, ArrayList<String>> nodes = new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>();
		Map<Integer, String> edges = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
		Map<Integer, String> BioPathSteps = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
	into one map denoted in GraphAdjList
		private Map<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> adjListMap;
		
2. "extractNodesFromEdge" can be more generic because it is used also above for the edges

3. make BioPaxApi to extend GraphAdjList because it needs the model so it can retrieve information at any time given that we have the https (RDFid)
