BioPAXElement 10 is: [name], [an electron-transfer quinone]
BioPAXElement 11 is: [comment], [This class holds |FRAME: Quinones quinones| that are involved in electron transfer within membranes. Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix. Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|. Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.]
